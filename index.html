                    year was i'm absent, but that time education style was simple and targets to coming students to schoole so, my teacher passed me to the next class with out any grade. by such a way i am reached to grade five.now, i'm grade five and come
                    to schoole with my responsibility, by this year i'm trying to study with schedule and guide me with plan,finally i scored good and rised number five. and then when i'm grade 6th and 7th i'm medium or approach to level student finally
                    i reach to grade eight. This year i'm taking grade eight ministry exam since in 2005, i scored good and pass to grade nine.

                <p>
                    This year is one of my unforgottable year in my life, because of i passed ministry exam and promoted to grade nine. with this year i start live in alone, preparing food and manage my self. in grade nine i was a medium student means i am neither very tallent
                    nor very weak, however, now i'm grde ten. in grade ten there had matric exam, this exam are very difficult to pass becuase, pass and fail system in ethiopia is depend on the present year students point itself or grade, not by result. so i was try to score good and pass to grade
                    eleven..... Lastly i got good grade and passed to grade eleven.
